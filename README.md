# Ayobami Pase — Cloud & DevOps Engineer Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, hosted at [**apase1.com**](https://apase1.com) and [**ayobami-devops.netlify.app**](https://ayobami-devops.netlify.app).  
It showcases my skills, certifications, DevOps projects, and professional experience in cloud engineering.
